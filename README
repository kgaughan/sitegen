sitegen
=======

A very stupid site generator. This was an exercise in how dumb I could make a
site generator and still keep it useful. The only dependency is pandoc_. It
expects a set of reStructuredText_ or Markdown_ files in the `source`
directory and will write its output to `out`. The index is an alphabetically
sorted list of document titles.

I'm planning on adding an option for also generating an index for a
gopherspace.
